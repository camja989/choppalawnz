# 🚀 Quick Performance Optimization Checklist

## ✅ COMPLETED - HTML Optimizations

### What I Fixed:
1. **Hero Image (LCP Fix)**
   - Removed lazy loading
   - Added `fetchpriority="high"`
   - Added width/height dimensions

2. **All Images (CLS Fix)**
   - Added explicit width and height to prevent layout shifts
   - Applied to: logo, profile, badges, gallery images

3. **External Resources**
   - Added preconnect hints for Google Fonts and Cloudflare CDN
   - Deferred non-critical CSS (Font Awesome, Google Fonts)
   - Kept critical CSS (styles.css) as blocking

## 🚨 NEXT STEP - IMAGE OPTIMIZATION (CRITICAL!)

### The Big Problem:
Your images are **8.8 MB** - this is why your LCP is 48.6 seconds! 

### Easiest Solution (5 minutes):
1. **Open https://squoosh.app in your browser**
2. **Upload these 3 files:**
   - `img/IMG_5261.jpeg` (5.3 MB)
   - `img/IMG_1650.jpeg` (2.3 MB)  
   - `img/updated logo.png` (1.2 MB)

3. **For each image:**
   - Select **WebP** format (left side)
   - Set quality to **85%**
   - Click **Resize** button, then:
     - Hero image: 800 × 1066 px
     - Profile: 300 × 300 px
     - Logo: 280 × 52 px
   - Click **Download**

4. **Replace the old files** (backup originals first!)
