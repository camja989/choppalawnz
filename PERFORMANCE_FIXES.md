# Performance Optimization Summary - Choppalawnz Website

## Changes Implemented ✅

### 1. Fixed Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) - Hero Image
**Problem:** Hero image had `loading="lazy"` which delayed its loading (48.6s LCP!)

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Removed `loading="lazy"` from hero image (`IMG_5261.jpeg`)
- ✅ Added `fetchpriority="high"` to prioritize loading
- ✅ Added explicit dimensions: `width="364" height="485"`

**Expected Impact:** LCP should improve from 48.6s → ~2-3s (when images are optimized)

---

### 2. Fixed Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
**Problem:** Images without width/height attributes caused layout shifts

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Logo: Added `width="140" height="26"`
- ✅ Profile image: Added `width="150" height="150"`
- ✅ BuildersCrack badges: Added `width="120" height="41"` and `width="140" height="48"`
- ✅ Gallery images: Added `width="400" height="300"`
- ✅ Shielded logo: Preserved existing `width="60" height="60"`

**Expected Impact:** CLS should improve from 0.087 → <0.1 (Good)

---

### 3. Eliminated Render-Blocking Resources
**Problem:** CSS files blocked page rendering for 3,420ms

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Added preconnect hints for:
  - `fonts.googleapis.com`
  - `fonts.gstatic.com` (with crossorigin)
  - `cdnjs.cloudflare.com`
- ✅ Deferred Font Awesome CSS loading (non-critical)
- ✅ Deferred Google Fonts loading (non-critical)
- ✅ Added fallback `<noscript>` tags for users without JavaScript

**Expected Impact:** First Contentful Paint should improve from 4.8s → ~1-2s
